DnD Client-Server

This project aims to solve the shortcomings that some friends and I are experiencing with a previously acquired DnD tool.
The DM can 'reveal' areas of a map that the Players, connected as a Client to the DM's Server instance, can see. The Server
instance has full visibility to the entire map and controls which areas are visible, the size of the on-screen grid (if any), etc.
The Client instance has visibility only what is allowed, and can zoom in/out for the appropriate experience.
